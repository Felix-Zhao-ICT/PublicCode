#bushey_monitor

During the summer of 2010, I configured a Digi International [ConnectPort X4](http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-routers-gateways/routing-gateways/connectportx4). This device provides a means of bridging XBee low energy devices onto the internet via the iDigi cloud. The kit I bought came with an indoor and outdoor temperature sensor. And what did any self respecting geek do in the summer of 2010? They put there devices onto twitter.

The code shown here was a rudimentary way of interacting with twitter in 2010, I am pretty sure it doesn't work anymore.

The monitor would never have worked without the most excellent [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) python library.
