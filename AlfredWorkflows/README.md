#Alfred Workflows

I have recently become a little obsessed with [Alfred 2.0](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflows. I have had the app installed for a long period of time, but am only now getting on top of how powerful the application can be. If you don't own it, and you own a Mac, stop, go buy it now.

I have decided that any of the workflows that I create I will share, to that end ...

##FunctionToggler

The Function Toggler workflow allows for the function keys on an Apple keyboard to be toggled from there default Apple use (brightness, music control etc) to *normal* function key behaviour that can be used by an application. This is particularly helpful if you use an application like Eagle Cad where there is an expectation of using the function keys to drive the application in a sensible way.

The workflow is also downloadable from the [Packal website](http://www.packal.org/workflow/toggle-function-keys)
