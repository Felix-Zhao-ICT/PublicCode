#Clokey public repo

This is the repository containing all of the code that I consider to be open source and free to use.

Attribution would be nice, but not required. Where I have used code from other projects, I have left the copyright as is, for cross reference

##MacOSXVirtualSerialPort

A Mac OS X 10.7 only application, that wraps the socat commandline tool, and creates a virtual serial port pair, useful for testing embedded device code without having the device present.
